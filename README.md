Description: This is a course project from CS5850 Building Game Engines: http://www.mshah.io/comp/Spring23/GameEngines/public/index.php taught by Mike Shah. The objective was to build the game Pong with SDL2. I took sometime to add a menu and some special game modes that can be toggled on and off. To compile, run 'python build.py' in the terminal; to run the executable ./lab in the root directory. You will need to install SDL2 and SDL_ttf to compile successfully.
